This is the repo for the capstone project of the Udacity Self-Driving Car Nanodegree: Programming a Real Self-Driving Car. For more information about the project, see the project introduction [here](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/6047fe34-d93c-4f50-8336-b70ef10cb4b2/modules/e1a23b06-329a-4684-a717-ad476f0d8dff/lessons/462c933d-9f24-42d3-8bdc-a08a5fc866e4/concepts/5ab4b122-83e6-436d-850f-9f4d26627fd9).

## Nodes Description

![alt-text][simulator]

### Waypoint Updater Node

Publishes waypoints from the car's current position to a given `x` distance ahead. If an upcoming stop light is detected, the velocity of the waypoints is adjusted and the vehicle decelerates or accelerates depending on the light state.

### Drive-By-Wire And Twist Controller

This is compose of multiple nodes

#### Drive-By-Wire Node

Represents a drive by wire controller. Receives current and requested steering/velocities, calculates and publishes throttle, brake and steering commands to the vehicle.

#### Twist Controller Node

Responsible for steering and acceleration. The acceleration is controlled via PID controller. Steering is calculated using YawController that calculates needed angle to keep needed velocity.

### Traffic Light Detection And Classification

Responsible for detecting traffic lights and classify their states (red, yellow, green).

To detect and classify the traffic lights in the images provided by the camera. I used Tensorflow's [Object Detection API](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/object_detection). The created Tensoflow graphs for simulator images and real images are included in the data directory.

Image dataset is based on images from the simulator and bag files provided for this project.
Images were preprocessed and scaled to a max width of 300px, to increase the prediction's performance 
 

## Installation

Please use **one** of the two installation options, either native **or** docker installation.

### Native Installation

* Be sure that your workstation is running Ubuntu 16.04 Xenial Xerus or Ubuntu 14.04 Trusty Tahir. [Ubuntu downloads can be found here](https://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop).
* If using a Virtual Machine to install Ubuntu, use the following configuration as minimum:
  * 2 CPU
  * 2 GB system memory
  * 25 GB of free hard drive space

  The Udacity provided virtual machine has ROS and Dataspeed DBW already installed, so you can skip the next two steps if you are using this.

* Follow these instructions to install ROS
  * [ROS Kinetic](http://wiki.ros.org/kinetic/Installation/Ubuntu) if you have Ubuntu 16.04.
  * [ROS Indigo](http://wiki.ros.org/indigo/Installation/Ubuntu) if you have Ubuntu 14.04.
* [Dataspeed DBW](https://bitbucket.org/DataspeedInc/dbw_mkz_ros)
  * Use this option to install the SDK on a workstation that already has ROS installed: [One Line SDK Install (binary)](https://bitbucket.org/DataspeedInc/dbw_mkz_ros/src/81e63fcc335d7b64139d7482017d6a97b405e250/ROS_SETUP.md?fileviewer=file-view-default)
* Download the [Udacity Simulator](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Capstone/releases).

### Docker Installation
[Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/)

Build the docker container
```bash
docker build . -t capstone
```

Run the docker file
```bash
docker run -p 4567:4567 -v $PWD:/capstone -v /tmp/log:/root/.ros/ --rm -it capstone
```

### Port Forwarding
To set up port forwarding, please refer to the [instructions from term 2](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/40f38239-66b6-46ec-ae68-03afd8a601c8/modules/0949fca6-b379-42af-a919-ee50aa304e6a/lessons/f758c44c-5e40-4e01-93b5-1a82aa4e044f/concepts/16cf4a78-4fc7-49e1-8621-3450ca938b77)

### Usage

1. Clone the project repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Capstone.git
```

2. Install python dependencies
```bash
cd CarND-Capstone
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Make and run styx
```bash
cd ros
catkin_make
source devel/setup.sh
roslaunch launch/styx.launch
```
4. Run the simulator

### Real world testing
1. Download [training bag](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B2_h37bMVw3iYkdJTlRSUlJIamM/view?usp=sharing) that was recorded on the Udacity self-driving car (a bag demonstraing the correct predictions in autonomous mode can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B2_h37bMVw3iT0ZEdlF4N01QbHc))
2. Unzip the file
```bash
unzip traffic_light_bag_files.zip
```
3. Play the bag file
```bash
rosbag play -l traffic_light_bag_files/loop_with_traffic_light.bag
```
4. Launch your project in site mode
```bash
cd CarND-Capstone/ros
roslaunch launch/site.launch
```
5. Confirm that traffic light detection works on real life images
